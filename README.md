## Advertisement Sale Prediction using Logistic Regression Classifier

This repository contains a project focused on predicting advertisement sales from existing customers using a logistic regression classifier.

### Features
* Advertisement sale prediction model using logistic regression
* Utilizes a dataset of digital ad sales (DigitalAd_dataset.csv)
* Includes Jupyter Notebook (Ad_Sale_Prediction.ipynb) and Python script (Ad_Sale_Prediction.py) for model implementation

### Installation
